# Project Boekhouding

**What?**

We will make a dynamic app for bar and restaurant owners. The app will calculate the total price of all drinks orderd and will alert the owner when the stock is running low.

**Why?**

To make their lives easier, so the barman doesn't have to get a calculator and work out the price. It will also be easier to see what is bought the most and what needs to be ordered more because the stock runs out fast.

**How?**

A database will hold all the items the bar sells and print them to the app, when the barman presses a button the item will be added to the selected user, the database will also keep track of how many items of a specific product are still in stock. We will use vue for the front end part of this project and we will use the slim framework for the database implementation. PHP will be used for the back end.
